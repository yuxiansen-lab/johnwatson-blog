         Where do I even begin?
        </p>
        <p>
         As the trending hashtag says: #sherlocklives
        </p>
        <p>
         Before we get to that, I hope you saw the other news. The pre-#sherlocklives news. The news that the police finally worked out that he was innocent. Everything I've said on this blog has been the truth and now everyone knows it. I just want to take a minute to thank those who commented on here saying that they still believed in him. It really helped.
        </p>
        <p>
         So yes. He's come back from the dead. Of course he has. Of course Sherlock Bloody Holmes could come back from the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
         Turns out he'd faked his death because Moriarty had threatened those close to him. Including me. He'd gone into hiding, happy to leave me and everyone else  thinking he was dead. He'd done it to save us but he hadn't trusted us enough to tell us what was really going on. Not sure I'll ever truly forgive him for that but as the saying goes, life goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
         He came back to London to foil a terrorist attack on the city. He came back to life only for us to nearly die. Again. It's all life or death with him. Nothing in-between.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was out having dinner with my girlfriend when he sauntered back into my world. He was dressed as a waiter. BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNY. He genuinely thought it would be funny to surprise me. I think he was more surprised when I nutted him. But let's not dwell on that because again, as the saying goes, life goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
         Only, of course, he comes back into my life which means I find myself being attacked, kidnapped and stuck in a bonfire. We still don't know why that happened. It had nothing to do with the terrorist plot. It was terrifying though. One of the scariest moments of my life. Trapped. Unable to move. I could hardly breathe. And all I could hear were children! Singing and laughing like they were in a horror movie. Not knowing that I was trapped in the bonfire. And then someone set it alight and that was me gone. Just about. Sherlock and my girlfriend turned up in the nick of time and saved me. It was probably Sherlock himself. Set it all up just so he could save my life so I'd forgive him about what he did. Nah, I know it wasn't really.
        </p>
        <p>
         At first, I didn't really welcome him back into my life. I couldn't. I mean I know he's a psychopath and I've accepted that but what he did this time, it was too much. So I ignored him and got on with my life. But God, it was dull. I knew he was back. I knew that he was out there having the time of his life and I was... working. But I wasn't going to give in. He even replaced me! I refused to go back to Baker Street so he replaced me with Molly Hooper and started solving cases while he worked on the terrorist thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         But then the whole kidnapping/bonfire thing happened. And he saved my life, of course. And I went to say thanks and... I was hooked. He's like a drug. He told me about the terrorist plot and I was hooked. I had to help him.
        </p>
        <p>
         He showed me this video of an Underground train leaving one station and arriving in another. Only the one passenger who'd been on the train had disappeared! Only then, he realised, it hadn't been the passenger. It had been a whole carriage! We investigated further and discovered that there was an old, disused station between the two stations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Underneath the Houses of Parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         We made our way there only to discover that the carriage was empty! But then we found out why there wasn't a bomb in the carriage. The carriage itself was the bomb. Every seat, every inch of it was covered in explosives. And it was primed to go off just a few minutes later. It would have destroyed the Houses of Parliament and wiped out the government. And, obviously, it would have killed us. But Sherlock, the clever bastard, knew where the off switch was.
        </p>
        <p>
         He saved our lives and he saved the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         And, as you'll have also seen on the news, Lord Moran was arrested. Yup, the terrorist was the Minister for Overseas Development. You can't trust anyone these days, can you?
        </p>
        <p>
         So that's it. Sherlock returns from the dead and we save the country. All in a day's work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Oh, and in other news, I've got engaged. But, it's not something I'm really going to talk about much here. I want to keep some things private. I will say, though, she's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Sorry, Sherlock :)
        </p>
        <p>
         So, yes. It's all good. Better than good. It's bloody brilliant. #sherlocklives means #johnwatsonlives.

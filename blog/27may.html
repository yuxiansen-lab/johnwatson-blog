        </p>
        <h3>
         The Poison Giant
        </h3>
        <p>
         It all started when I received an email. There was no text just a picture of a pearl. I assumed it was spam but then, the next day, there was another one. Another email, another picture. Another pearl. And again and again. Six days, six pearls.
        </p>
        <p>
         And then it just stopped with no explanation. I was happy to ignore it but Sherlock was intrigued. I think the thing that intrigued him the most was that I'd received the emails rather than him. Well, I think it irritated him. Well, I know it did. He called me one morning, shouting and demanding to know why the interesting people always emailed me and never him. Sometimes he really is just like a little kid.
        </p>
        <p>
         We were able to trace the emails to a warehouse in Wapping owned by a Daniel Brennan. We found the warehouse but, unfortunately, we also found Daniel Brennan. He was lying next to a laptop, having been shot by a poisoned dart. Not that Sherlock noticed. He was too busy searching the laptop for further clues. He'd already worked out that basically we were on a treasure hunt. I made a joke about Anneka Rice's bum but he didn't get it.
        </p>
        <p>
         We took the laptop back to Baker Street and examined it. It seemed to belong to someone called James Swandale, judging by the documents he'd oh-so-carelessly left on it. I didn't need Sherlock to tell me that it was some kind of trap. But still, he did.
        </p>
        <p>
         He'd heard of Swandale. He was a jewel thief who could apparently get into lots of places easily because he was... well... short. Really, very short. I'm not sure what the correct word is these days.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I couldn't understand was why he'd emailed me in the first place. Why  lead me to an innocent man who he'd killed? And, most weirdly, why lead me to a laptop full of clues as to the location of his next heist? Obviously it was a trick of some sort. He wanted us to go the wrong place. But even then, why send me the emails at all? Or was it all a trick by someone else? Was someone else setting up Swandale? To be honest, I was baffled. But then again, when am I not baffled?
        </p>
        <p>
         But Sherlock was Sherlock. It was all a big game. Someone had started a new game with him and he had to win. That was something I'd learnt myself quite quickly into our friendship.
        </p>
        <p>
         The big clue we had to go on was that Swandale had got hold of the plans of a house belonging to some pop star from the 90s called Giles Conover. He'd been 'big on the indie scene' apparently. I don't actually know what that means but there you go.
        </p>
        <p>
         So off we went to do a stakeout. At night. And that's when we met James Swandale. He was, to be honest, terrifying. And he had his poisoned dart with him. And he had a friend. A big friend. A really big friend. Sherlock recognised him as Phil Dickinson, known to some as The Headcrusher. So, there we were being chased across a rooftop by Swandale and his poisoned dart only to run straight into this bloke who could break me in half with his bare hands.
        </p>
        <p>
         And that's what it had all been about. Somebody had wanted us dead and rather than hire an assassin had hired a pair of jewel thieves who were like the parallel evil universe version of Little and Large. They were trying to outfox Sherlock by not playing by the rules.
        </p>
        <p>
         We escaped, obviously. Sherlock's good with a sword and I'd bought a gun. One of them went off the roof and the other's currently in prison.
        </p>
        <p>
         We never found out who was trying to kill us. I felt we should investigate further but Sherlock had already dismissed it as boring and irrelevant. He was far more interested in a phone call he'd just received from Greg.
        </p>
        <p>
         About an elephant.
        </p>
        <p>
         So that was that. Off we went. Ready to solve our next case. It's exhausting but, God, I've missed this life.
